        This is the map of Britannia. It is 256x256 tiles in total and broken up into 64 32x32 chunks; 
        the total file is 65,536 bytes long. The first chunk is in the top left corner; 
        the next is just to the right of it, and so on. The last chunk is in the bottom right corner. 
        Each tile is stored as a byte that maps to a tile in SHAPES.EGA.The chunks are stored in the same way as the overall map: 
        left to right and top to bottom.

        The "chunked" layout is an artifact of the limited memory on the original machines that ran Ultima IV. 
        The whole map would take 64kb, too much for a C64 or an Apple II, so the game would keep a limited number of 1k chunks in memory 
        at a time.As the player moved around, old chunks were thrown out as new ones were swapped in.
