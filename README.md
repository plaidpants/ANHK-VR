# ANHK-VR

This is an early alpha attempt to run the original Ultima 4 in VR. Currently it will run on the Windows PC with an Oculus Rift but other systems may be supported in the future.

Instructions:

Aquire or purchase a free copy of Ultima 4 from gog.com or other source.

https://www.gog.com/en/game/ultima_4

Install the game on your Windows PC in a folder.

e.g. [GOGLibrary]\Ultima 4 - Quest of the Avatar

Run the game at least once to create a party and start the game and save the game using the "(I)nitiate New Game" and "(J)ourney onward" and "(Q)uit & save" function. This will create a game save file.

Download, rename and place in the install folder the original mockingboard music or other suitable music in mp3 format.
